# ProtoGraphics  
**Brief Description:**    

A simple program for drawing graphics and exporting to various image formats.  

**Goal:** 

To provide a simple open-source program that can be used to make graphics which could then be exported to
as many possible formats as possible. It could function as a standalone image/icon creator. Or be used alongside
other graphics programs for example animation programs or video-editing programs which lack a good defined way
of creating images.

note:  
The program is still in its very early stages. Once there is an actual working phase reached I will make the first 
release.
